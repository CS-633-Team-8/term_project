# Getting Started

_Everything you need to know to get up and running with Harold_

## 1. The React components

These components are reusable, well-maintained and accessible. If you want an introduction to react, we recommend looking [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). For information on how to use our components in your app:

- The [packages section](/packages) of this site has documentation, code samples and examples that can be opened in codesandbox for all of our components, which can be individually installed for use in projects.
- Open any of the examples in codesandbox to quickly experiment with the components.
